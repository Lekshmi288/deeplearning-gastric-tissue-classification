# Deep Learning for Gastric Tumor Microenvironment (TME) Classification

Leverage the [HMU-GC-HE-30K dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04489-9) from Lou et al. (2025) to build deep learning models that classify histological image patches into eight tumor microenvironment (TME) tissue types.

TME components play a critical role in gastric cancer progression, immune tolerance, and treatment response. However, detailed TME-annotated image datasets are scarce. This dataset addresses that gap by providing 30,000+ expert-labeled patches across eight biologically meaningful tissue types, along with matched clinical metadata.

Unlike simple tumor vs non-tumor classification, which provides only coarse segmentation, TME-based classification captures the diverse cellular and structural components within the tumor region that are known to influence tumor progression, immune evasion, and treatment response. By modeling these fine-grained patterns, the goal is to:

- Explore TME composition patterns in gastric cancer
- Link tissue patterns with clinical features
- Lay the groundwork for biomarker discovery and prognosis modeling

## Project Plan
- ‚úÖ Develop a baseline binary classifier (Tumor vs Non-Tumor) for prototyping
- ‚è≥ Extend to multi-class classification (8 TME tissue types)
- ‚è≥ Use transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
- ‚è≥ Apply Grad-CAM for interpretability
- ‚è≥ Explore patch-level TME composition analysis per patient
- ‚è≥ Build basic multimodal links with clinical metadata
- ‚è≥ Deploy a minimal Streamlit demo app

## üìå Notes

- Some tissue classes (e.g., adipose, smooth muscle) are biologically ‚Äúnormal‚Äù tissues but still part of the **tumor context** and can play roles in progression or immune evasion.
- This is not a normal-vs-cancer dataset. All patches come from gastric cancer samples. Labels represent **TME composition**, not pathology status.
